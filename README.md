SMOC is a self-hosted Discord ticket system bot that makes managing support effortless and professional. With commands like ``/ticket_create_suppor``t, ``/ticket_create_store``, ``/ticket_create_report``, and ``/ticket_create_developer``, users can easily open tickets for help, store inquiries, staff reports, or developer suggestions and bug submissions. The ``/embedhelp`` command sends a clean, informative guide to your chosen channel, helping users navigate the system. Because it's self-hosted, SMOC is fully customizable, allowing you to personalize the bot’s features, appearance, and responses to best suit your server’s needs.
